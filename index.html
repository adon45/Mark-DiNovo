        <p id="tribute-info">When Mark was just a lad, he was the coolest lad in school. Never once did he make any bad decisions. Once Mark became a geezer, he made a few bad choices, the baddest of which was working at Harvest Hope and hiring a room full of funny chaps (the funniest being Austin). Now Mark knows no peace while at work but hey, at least it's a fun time!</p>
